1. hilbert_curve.py - tools for building hilbert curves

2. show_hc.py - just draws hilbert curve in 2D space

3. mesh_metis_graph.py model_block_mesh [metis_decomposition]
    Arguments:
        model_block_mesh - block mesh in model format:
            bnx, bny, pnx, pny
            bm,   bn,   bglob_proc(bm, bn),   bglob_weight(bm, bn)
            ...
        metis_decomposition - file with decomposition from METIS program (just a output from METIS)
    Description:
        If only 1 argument is given then program transform model_block_mesh to METIS graph format. 
            You can use this graph as input for METIS.
        If 2 arguments are given then program reads decomposition from METIS and print this decomposition in model format
            You can use this as input for model (in mode 2)

4. decomposition model_block_mesh [marker_size] - draws decomposition with colors

5. gpmetis [options] graphfile nparts - METIS decomposition. See details in METIS manual.
