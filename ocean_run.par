            0  : 0 - start from minimum conditions, 1 - start from the full checkpoint
         5.0d0 : Model time step in seconds
          0.5  : Duration of the run (in days)
            0  : Time step number (0 matches to 01 January 00:00:00)
         2007  : Initial year (i4.4)
           30  : Periodicity for writing local  instantaneous data (in minutes). If >1440.0, then output is once per day. If <=0 then no local output is done
       1440.0  : Periodicity for writing global time averaged data (in minutes). If >1440.0, then output is once per month. If <0 then only checkpoints are written
